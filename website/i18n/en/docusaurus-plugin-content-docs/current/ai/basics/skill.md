# Skill (skill system)

`weapp-tailwindcss` official skill is for business project users. It splits the current v5 access, migration, troubleshooting and advanced capabilities into independent workflows, avoiding the need for one big Skill to maintain all frameworks and APIs at the same time.

This project uses [`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install Skill. `sonofmagic/weapp-tailwindcss` is the content source of fact, and `sonofmagic/skills` is the user-facing aggregated installation repository.

## Install the complete package

```bash
npx skills add sonofmagic/skills \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-setup \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-migrate \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-troubleshoot \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-runtime \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-custom-build \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-react-native \
  -y
```

You can also install only the compatible coordination entrance:

```bash
npx skills add sonofmagic/skills --skill weapp-tailwindcss
```

The coordination portal is responsible for identifying tasks and recommending specialized skills; the complete implementation and reference materials are located in each specialized skill.

View all installable content in the aggregation warehouse:

```bash
npx skills add sonofmagic/skills --list
```

## Skill division of labor

| Skill                            | Usage scenarios                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `weapp-tailwindcss`              | Generalized request, task identification, security baseline and compatibility entry |
| `weapp-tailwindcss-setup`        | New access, framework selection, Tailwind CSS 4 and multi-terminal configuration    |
| `weapp-tailwindcss-migrate`      | v4 to v5, old patch/generated plug-in and environment migration                     |
| `weapp-tailwindcss-troubleshoot` | Style generation, class translation, rpx, HMR and runtime troubleshooting           |
| `weapp-tailwindcss-runtime`      | Dynamic class, merge, cva, variants and escape/unescape                             |
| `weapp-tailwindcss-custom-build` | Core API, self-developed bundler, style injection and sub-packaging isolation       |
| `weapp-tailwindcss-react-native` | Expo Metro, Native manifest and Android/iOS runtime                                 |

## Current common baseline

- Currently, only Tailwind CSS 4 is maintained on the mainline.
- The current `weapp-tailwindcss` manifest requires Node.js `^22.18.0 || >=24.11.0`; the HBuilderX project uses at least 5.11.
- The same managed build only generates Tailwind CSS by `WeappTailwindcss`, without overlaying the official Tailwind PostCSS/Vite generation plug-in.
- Tailwind entry uses pure CSS and must be actually imported by the project; `cssEntries` uses absolute paths and cannot replace the build map import.
- H5/Web usually retains plug-ins, and the generator automatically selects the Web target.
- JavaScript class only converts Tailwind-verified exact candidates of `classNameSet`.

## Local development installation

Execute in the root directory of this warehouse:

```bash
npx skills add . \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-setup \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-migrate \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-troubleshoot \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-runtime \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-custom-build \
  --skill weapp-tailwindcss-react-native \
  -y
```
