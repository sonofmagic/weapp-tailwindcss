# Experimental Design Checklist

## Research Question Formulation

### Is the Question Well-Formed?

- [ ] **Specific:** Clearly defined variables and relationships
- [ ] **Answerable:** Can be addressed with available methods
- [ ] **Relevant:** Addresses a gap in knowledge or practical need

- [ ] Determined typical effect sizes in the field

## Hypothesis Development

### Is Your Hypothesis Testable?

- [ ] Specifies direction/nature of expected relationships
- [ ] Can be falsified by potential observations

### Types of Hypotheses

- [ ] **Null hypothesis (H₀):** No effect/relationship exists
- [ ] **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** Effect/relationship exists
- [ ] **Directional vs. non-directional:** One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

## Study Design Selection

### What Type of Study is Appropriate?

**Experimental (Intervention) Studies:**

- [ ] **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):** Gold standard for causation
- [ ] **Quasi-experimental:** Non-random assignment but manipulation
- [ ] **Within-subjects:** Same participants in all conditions
- [ ] **Between-subjects:** Different participants per condition
- [ ] **Factorial:** Multiple independent variables
- [ ] **Crossover:** Participants receive multiple interventions sequentially

**Observational Studies:**

- [ ] **Cohort:** Follow groups over time
- [ ] **Case-control:** Compare those with/without outcome
- [ ] **Cross-sectional:** Snapshot at one time point
- [ ] **Ecological:** Population-level data

**Consider:**

- [ ] Can you randomly assign participants?
- [ ] Can you manipulate the independent variable?
- [ ] Is the outcome rare (favor case-control) or common?
- [ ] Do you need to establish temporal sequence?
- [ ] What's feasible given ethical, practical constraints?

## Variables
