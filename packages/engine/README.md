# @weapp-tailwindcss/engine

> English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Candidate extraction, source scanning, and style generation for Tailwind CSS 4. Use this package independently or through `weapp-tailwindcss`, its PostCSS package, and CLI.

```ts
import { createTailwindV4Engine, resolveTailwindV4Source } from '@weapp-tailwindcss/engine'

const source = await resolveTailwindV4Source({
  projectRoot: process.cwd(),
  css: '@import "tailwindcss";',
})
const engine = createTailwindV4Engine(source)
const result = await engine.generate({ candidates: ['flex', 'text-red-500'] })
console.log(result.css)
```

The root entry exports candidate extraction, position reports, source scanning, and the v4 API. `@weapp-tailwindcss/engine/v4` exports the v4 API. Both entries support ESM, CJS, and TypeScript. Extract candidates from templates, JavaScript strings, SFCs, and CSS `@apply`, with source positions and valid candidate sets.

Supports `@source`, multiple CSS sources, the design system, bare arbitrary values, incremental generation sessions, and cache disposal. Only Tailwind CSS 4 is supported. There are no v3, multi-version dispatcher, custom generator, or HTML parser compatibility entry points. Platform compatibility transforms belong to `@weapp-tailwindcss/postcss`.

## Source

The source and corresponding v4 and extraction tests were migrated from the MIT-licensed [tailwindcss-mangle](https://github.com/sonofmagic/tailwindcss-mangle/tree/6bf58cebe073a06dfeac7ed44f55ecff50deb763/packages/engine) commit identified by the npm provenance for `@tailwindcss-mangle/engine@0.2.0`. The original [MIT license](./LICENSE) is retained. This package is maintained independently and does not depend on the old engine or a local submodule at runtime.
