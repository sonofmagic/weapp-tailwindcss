This plugin allows you to use tailwindcss in `weapp`. At the same time, it provides the functions of tailwindcss class name escape and mangle.

> What's [`weapp`](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/wx) ?
> it is a program running in [`WeChat`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat),[Alipay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alipay) or other third-party applications.  
> `weapp` is a new open capability. Developers can quickly develop a small program. Mini Programs can be easily obtained and disseminated within WeChat. At the same time, have an excellent user experience.

The core plugin supports `webpack`/`vite`/`gulp` for building, covering almost all mainstream development frameworks for weapp.

These plugins can automatically identify and accurately handle all `tailwindcss` tool classes to adapt to the applet environment. At the same time, these plugins also can compress and confuse the tool class names generated by `tailwindcss`. This ability shortens the length of `css` selectors, reduces the size of generated styles, and makes class names unreadable in production.

### Plugin Introduction

The `UnifiedWebpackPluginV5` exported from `weapp-tailwindcss/webpack` is a core plugin that can be used by all frameworks that use `webpack` for packaging.

The `UnifiedViteWeappTailwindcssPlugin` exported from `weapp-tailwindcss/vite` is a dedicated plugin for `vite`, and the configuration items and usage are consistent with the `webpack` plugin.

And our `gulp` plugin method, can be exported from `weapp-tailwindcss/gulp`.

Currently, these plugins support the latest version of the `tailwindcss v3.x.x` version and `webpack5`, `vite`, and `gulp`.

> If you are still using the `tailwindcss@2` version, then you should use the `1.x` version of this plugin. Also, make sure your `nodejs` version `>=16`. At present, the long-term maintenance version (`even-numbered version`) below `16` has ended its life cycle. It is recommended to install the `LTS` version of `nodejs`, See [nodejs/release](<https://github.com/> nodejs/release)

### template

#### how to choose？

If you just develop a combination of `weapp` + `h5`, then using `vscode` template is enough

If the key platform of your project is `app`, it is recommended to use the `hbuilderx` template, because `hbuilderx` comes with a toolchain for `app` construction and debugging, which can better support your development.
